Flexbox 101 - 
Lesson 1 - introduction

Flexbox is a framework that arranges items into rows or columns. 
These items will flex (grow/shrink) based on rules that are defined. 

How to set up a flex container;
.container { 
display: flex; << Essential | Display type = Flex
}

How to set up a flex item
.item {
flex: 1;      << Essential | Flex = Enabled (Truthy value = Enabled)
}

Elements can be Flex containers AND flex items together. 
Ex; a box containing 3 boxes. (With an even split).
and each of those boxes contain 2 boxes. (With an 80/20 split).


Q) Whatâ€™s the difference between a flex container and a flex item?
A)  Flex container allows the elements within to grow/shrink|flex 
    Flex item grow/shrink|flexes to fit the container 

Q) How do you create a flex item?
A) flex: 1; (Truthy value for enabled)


Lesson 2 - Growing and Shrinking

flex: 1;
is shorthand for

flex:   1   1   0%;
flex-grow: (1st)
flex-shrink: (2nd)
flex-basis: (3rd)

Most common; 
flex:1;         - Flex enabled
flex-shrink:0;  - Flex-Shrink - Disabled 

flex-grow:      an items growth factor flex:2; will grow twice the size of flex:1;

flex-shrink:    if space avalible < hardcoded space - flex-shrink enables the flex items to shrink to fit
                flex-shrink:1; = Items will shrink evenly
                flex-shrink:2; = (or more) Items will shrink more than others
                flex-shrink:0; = Items won't shrink evenly. 

Warning: Flex grow/shrink items don't respect hardcoded values. 

flex-basis:     sets the initial size of a flex item. and flex begins from the baseline size.
                shorthand defaults is flex-basis:0%;
                Can enable flex-basis:auto;
                >flex-basis tells item to check width declaration

Q) What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property (e.g. flex: 1 1 auto)?
A) flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis


Lesson 03 - Axes
Flexboxes can Flex in the row(X)-axis (Default Left>Right), 
as well as the column(Y)-axis (Default Top>Bottom)..

Flexboxes default to row(X)-axis. can be set to column(Y)-axis.
Wiiiith; 

flex-direction: column;

If direction= column, flex:1; does not work as intended. 
(B/c it sets basis:0%)

if direction= column, use flex: 1 1 auto;

if direction=column, flex-basis refers to height, not width. 

Back on topic; Default direction = Row  

Q) How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?
A) flex-direction: column;

Q) In a column flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
A) flex-basis refers to height, rather than width.

Q) In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
A) flex-basis by default, refers to width.

Q) Why do the previous two questions have different answers?
A)  Flex-basis looks to see if there is a given value to begin grow/shrinking from.
    When flexing by Row (Xaxis), height is irrelivant.
    When flexing by Columnm (Yaxis), width is irrelivant.
