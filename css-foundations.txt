Lesson 01 - introduction
CSS - Cascading Style Sheet

Basic Syntax; 
selector {
    property: value;
}

Universal selector = *
* { 
    property: value;
}

Class selector = .
.classname {
    property: value;
}

ID selector - # (Unique - Use sparingly if at all)
#IDname {
    property:value;
}

Grouping Selectors   (Will effect both class A and class B)
.classname1,
.classname2 {
    property: value;
}

Chaining Selectors   (Will effect a single selector with both class A and class B)
.classname1.classname2 {
    property: value;
}

Descendant Selectors   (With a space - No limit - Can search for 5th generation)
.parent .child  {
    property: value;
}

Selector is the HTML Element to which the CSS rules apply
>What is being selected for each rule 


Begining Properties

color
background-color

Can Use 
HEX color:  #1100ff80; (#1100ff;) <<<< Fav
(With or W/o transparency) 
RGB color:  rgb(100, 0, 127);
HSL:        hsl(15,82%, 56%);


font-family ~ Sets font style 
font-family: "Font1", fallback-font;

font-size   ~ Sets font size
font-size: Xpx;

font-weight ~ Sets boldness
font-weight:    bold;  
                (or 100 - 900 in increments of 100)
                
text-align  ~ Alligns text horizontally within element
text-align: center; 

the height and width of an image can be defined

img {
     height: auto; 
     width: 500px
}

The Cascade ~ If there's a specificity tie; Whoever was last - Wins

Specificity 
ID Selectors > Class selectors > Type Selectors 

Inheritance ~ The child will inherit some of the aspects of the parent
Namely the typography properties (color font-size, font-family)


Adding Css to html

Option 1) External CSS 

a) Create css file within file structure "styles.css"

b) In the head of the HTML; insert link with the css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> 

Option 2) Internal CSS 

a) in the head of the HTML; add <style></style>

b) code all css inside there.

Option 3) Inline CSS 

a) In the body of the HTML; add the style="xxx;"

b) Can work for a unique style for a single element
    Otherwise dont use this.

Q) What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?
A) External - Saved Outside the HTML / Internal - Saved in the Head the HTML / Inline - Saved in the line of html.

Q) What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
A) Class = .classname {} / ID = #IDname {}

Q) How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
A)  .selector1,
    .selector2 { }

Q) Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
A)  #title.rule { }

Q) What does the descendant combinator do?
A) Combines parent and child as selector; 
Ex; Div p { } Will only be actioned on paragraphs inside a div. 

Q) Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
ID > Class > selector
