Lesson 01 - introduction
CSS - Cascading Style Sheet

Basic Syntax; 
selector {
    property: value;
}

Universal selector = *
* { 
    property: value;
}

Class selector = .
.classname {
    property: value;
}

ID selector - # (Unique - Use sparingly if at all)
#IDname {
    property:value;
}

Grouping Selectors   (Will effect both class A and class B)
.classname1,
.classname2 {
    property: value;
}

Chaining Selectors   (Will effect a single selector with both class A and class B)
.classname1.classname2 {
    property: value;
}

Descendant Selectors   (With a space - No limit - Can search for 5th generation)
.parent .child  {
    property: value;
}

Selector is the HTML Element to which the CSS rules apply
>What is being selected for each rule 


Begining Properties

color
background-color

Can Use 
HEX color:  #1100ff80; (#1100ff;) <<<< Fav
(With or W/o transparency) 
RGB color:  rgb(100, 0, 127);
HSL:        hsl(15,82%, 56%);


font-family ~ Sets font style 
font-family: "Font1", fallback-font;

font-size   ~ Sets font size
font-size: Xpx;

font-weight ~ Sets boldness
font-weight:    bold;  
                (or 100 - 900 in increments of 100)
                
text-align  ~ Alligns text horizontally within element
text-align: center; 

the height and width of an image can be defined

img {
     height: auto; 
     width: 500px
}

The Cascade ~ If there's a specificity tie; Whoever was last - Wins

Specificity 
ID Selectors > Class selectors > Type Selectors 

Inheritance ~ The child will inherit some of the aspects of the parent
Namely the typography properties (color font-size, font-family)


Adding Css to html

Option 1) External CSS 

a) Create css file within file structure "styles.css"

b) In the head of the HTML; insert link with the css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> 

Option 2) Internal CSS 

a) in the head of the HTML; add <style></style>

b) code all css inside there.

Option 3) Inline CSS 

a) In the body of the HTML; add the style="xxx;"

b) Can work for a unique style for a single element
    Otherwise dont use this.

    .selector2 { }

Q) Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
A)  #title.rule { }

Q) What does the descendant combinator do?
A) Combines parent and child as selector; 
Ex; Div p { } Will only be actioned on paragraphs inside a div. 

Q) Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
ID > Class > selector

Lesson 02; Inspecting your code! 

Use Chrome Dev tools to inspect / test out code 

Q) How do you select a specific element on your page with your browser’s developer tools?
A)  Right-Click, Inspect

A)  Play with it inside the inspector. 
    You can make changes to the code on the webpage 
    Without effecting the source code.  

Lesson 03; The Box Model 

Every little thing, is just a little box. 
Everything on a website is a box. - Errytin'

Spacing for the Box model; Padding, Border, Margin

Content:    The element <p>I like cheese</p>
Padding:    Distance from Content to Border
Border:     Layer between padding/Margin
Margin:     Distance between border and other elements  
            (Margin collapses between elements 60px + 60px = still 60px)

Standard Box Model / Size of element = 
border (20px)  +
padding (20px) +
height / width (100px * 100px) +
padding (20px)+
border (20px) +

Ends up as 180px 

Alternative Box Model / Size of element 
Overwritten by; 'box-sizing: border-box;'

This shrinks the entire element to 100px

Box-Model Properties 

box-sizing
display
float
line-height
position
z-index 

Q) From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?
A) Content, Wrapped in Padding, Wrapped in Border, Wrapped in Margin 

Q) What does the box-sizing CSS property do?
A) Allows the box-model to be set to an alternative size

Q) What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?
A)  Standard adds padding(x2) and border(x2) to the size of the element
    Whereas the alternative includes them by taking space away from the content. 

Q) Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2 elements?
A) Space outside of a Border? Use Margin!

Q) Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the contents of an element and its border?

Q) Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to overlap each other?
A) Still outside of a border, Use Margin! Use negative Margin!

Lesson 4 - Block and inline
*Normal Flow* = webpage elements lay themselves out in a default manner
(if you haven't messed with them)

Block elements begin on a new line
display: block;
Ex: <h1> </h1>

Inline elements do not. 
display: inline-block;
Ex; <a> </a>

padding: 2px, 10px, 20px, 15px;

if padding has three values; it is top, left+right, bottom.
padding: 10px, 15px, 20px;

if padding has 2 values it is top+bottom, left+right.
padding: 10px, 50px;

if padding has 1 value; it is all sides. 
padding: 50px;
