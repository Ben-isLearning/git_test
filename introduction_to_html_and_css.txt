Lesson 03 - Creating a HTML file.

All HTML documents have the same basic structure (refered to as a boilerplate)
Step 1 - Create new folder / create index.html within. Lets play!

A Boilerplate begins with a prefix by declaring what type the document is 
<!DOCTYPE html> 

Then actually begins with a Root element + what verbal language the page is for 
<html lang="en"> (everything else) </html>

First comes the brains of the operation 
<head> 
Important information, character sets, title of page, etc
</head>

Then comes the other 95% of the code 
<body> 
Everything else goes here, all headings content etc. 
</body>

Q) What is the purpose of the Doctype Declaration? 
A) To inform the web broswer what version of HTML it should use 

Q) What is the HTML element? 
A) The HTML element is the root element, the rest of out website / Tree will grow from this. 

Q) What is the purpose of the head element?
A) To provide the web browser with meta information about the webpage / stuff required to render pages correctly

Q) What is the pursose of the body element? 
A) To hold 95%+ of the website - all of this information will be accessible/shown to the user.
